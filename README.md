# Mystery-Man
A lovely watercolor and doodle of a mysterious figure, their features cloaked in shadow and subtle hues âœ¨

His form hinted at through loose brushstrokes and muted colors, creating a sense of enigma and allure. 

In this drawing, I experimented with watercolors, silhouettes, and doodles!
